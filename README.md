# PYTHON-DAF
Plays audio back to you with a delay.
There were no decent alternatives to the paid software on windows.


For more info about DAF, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_Auditory_Feedback
DEPENDENCIES: pyaudio

USAGE: python daf.py delay_milliseconds

NOTE: The delay might not be 100% accurate, as I've yet to test this.
I doubt that I'll make this any more user friendly.
Volume is controlled by the OS, uses the default input device.
